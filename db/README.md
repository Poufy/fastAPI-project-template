## The db_* files are similar to controllers in an MVC architecture.

The db folder in a FastAPI project could be considered equivalent to a controller folder in a traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

In an MVC architecture, the controller is responsible for handling the incoming requests, interacting with the model (which represents the data and business logic) and then passing the result to the view (which is responsible for displaying the data to the user).

Similarly, in a FastAPI project, the api folder would handle the incoming requests, the db folder would be responsible for interacting with the database and performing CRUD operations on the data, and then passing the result back to the api folder.

So, you can think of the db folder as a controller in the sense that it's responsible for handling the logic and data-related operations, as well as interacting with the underlying data storage (in this case, the database) and returning the results back to the API.
